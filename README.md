The aim of this project is to provide a movement standardisation assistance system for fitness beginners using deep learning and image recognition technologies. Due to the increasing popularity of fitness, many people want to improve their physical condition and appearance through exercise, but the lack of proper guidance and supervision may easily lead to the risk of substandard movements or injuries. Therefore, we would like to propose a fitness exercise quality assessment system based on deep learning and computer vision, which can use a camera to capture the subject's movements in real time, compare them with standard movements, analyse the correctness of the movements and suggestions for improvement, and provide real-time feedback to the user through the screen, helping them to quickly master the essentials and details of fitness movements.
